## Discussion and Recommendation

1.	Between 2013 and 2016, Parch and Posey experienced remarkable growth in terms of sales and revenue. However, in 2017, the company witnessed a significant decline in sales, leading to a drop in revenue. This trend could be attributed to various factors, including changes in consumer behavior, market competition, or company strategy. It would be imperative for Parch and Posey to conduct a thorough analysis of the market and reassess their business plan to regain their footing and continue their growth trajectory.

2.	Between the years 2014 and 2016, the standard paper type experienced a significant increase in sales compared to other paper types. However, in the year 2017, its sales were overtaken by the gloss paper type, which became the more popular choice among consumers. 

3.	Over the course of the last four years, from 2014 to 2017, a consistent pattern of monthly revenue growth was noticed. Specifically, I have observed a steady increase in revenue at the start of each year, followed by a peak towards the end of the year. This trend has been consistent each year, suggesting a reliable and predictable pattern in revenue generation. 

4.	After conducting a thorough analysis, it was discovered that the decline in sales during the year 2017 can be attributed to an incomplete compilation of monthly sales data. The only recorded month for that year was January, which resulted in a lack of visibility into sales trends for the rest of the year. This incomplete data made it difficult to identify potential issues and take proactive measures to address them, ultimately leading to lower overall sales. 

5.	Analysis shows that orders peak at the end of every year. During observed peak periods, temporary staffing can be embraced to ensure that all required orders are met. Advertisements should be carried out at the beginning of the year as low sales have been observed. 

6.	It is important to show appreciation to certain companies on special occasions in order to maintain their loyalty. These are groups of customers who have already reached a high level of loyalty and do not require additional advertisements. Instead, efforts should be directed towards companies that are not performing as well. Targeted advertisements and reminder programs can help increase purchases from these companies. 

7.	Recognize and reward high-performing Sales reps in terms of top sales and orders. Analyze the strategies used by them to identify best practices for the team. Provide support or training to managers with lower sales and profits to improve their performance.
